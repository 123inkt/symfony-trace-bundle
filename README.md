# Symfony Trace Bundle

*Based on [chrisguitarguy/RequestIdBundle](https://github.com/chrisguitarguy/RequestIdBundle)*

This adds trace ID's to your Symfony application. Why? It's a great way to add
some additional information to logs and to present to users. The trace id will 
be available in:
- Monolog log messages
- Request -> Response
- Console command
- Twig as extension
- HttpClient requests (by default only enabled for tagged clients)
- Messenger messages (by default enabled)
- Sentry reports (by default disabled)

## Installation

Use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).
```
composer require digitalrevolution/symfony-trace-bundle
```

Then enable the bundle in your `/config/bundles.php`:

```php
# /config/bundles.php
<?php

return [
    ...
    DR\SymfonyTraceBundle\SymfonyTraceBundle::class => ['all' => true],
];
```

## Configuration

By default, the bundle will use the [W3C TraceContext](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) standard to receive and pass on the traceId.<br> 
For configuration details see: [TraceContext configuration](docs/configuration/tracecontext.md)

It's also possible to configure the bundle to setup custom request/response headers and custom ID generators.  
Read more about the available configuration options on [TraceId configuration](docs/configuration/traceid.md) in the /docs pages.

## How it Works

When a request arrives, it is inspected for request header containing a traceId. If present,
the value in that header will be used throughout the rest of the bundle. This
lets you use trace ID's from somewhere higher up in the stack (like in the web
server itself).

If no trace ID is found, one is generated by the `TraceIdGeneratorInterface`.
In tracecontext mode, the IDs are generated according to the TraceContext standard.
The default generator in traceId mode creates version 4 UUIDs.

On the way out, a response header can be set on the response as well using
the value(s) described above.

The headers are configurable. See the [configuration](#configuration) above.
Internally a transaction ID is generator as well. This ID is used to identify a single request.

## Monolog Integration

There's a monolog *Processor* that adds the trace ID and transaction ID to `extra` array on the record.
This can be turned off by setting `monolog.enabled` to `false` in the configuration.

To use the trace ID in your logs, include `%extra.trace_id%` in your formatter.
To use the transaction ID in your logs, include `%extra.transaction_id%` in your formatter.
Here's a configuration example from this bundle's tests.

```php
# /config/services.php
$services->set('trace_id_formatter', LineFormatter::class)
    ->arg('$format', "[%%datetime%%][%%extra.trace_id%%][%%extra.transaction_id%%] %%channel%%.%%level_name%%: %%message%% %%extra%%\n")
    ->arg('$dateFormat', "Y-m-d\TH:i:s");
```
```php
# /config/packages/monolog.php
$monolog->handler('main')
        ->type('stream')
        ->path('%kernel.logs_dir%/error.%kernel.environment%.log')
        ->level('debug')
        ->formatter('trace_id_formatter')        
        ->channels()->elements(["!event"]);
```

## Messenger Integration

By default, the full trace data of the dispatcher process, will be added to the `Envelope` of the message. On the consumer
side the trace data will be applied to the running consumer process. Once the `Envelope` has been handled, the values 
will be reset to the original values of the consumer process (if any).

## Twig Integration

By default, this bundle will add a global `trace_id` and `transaction_id` function to your twig
environment. To disable this set `twig.enabled` to `false` in the bundle
configuration.

Here's an example of a template.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello, World</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>{{ trace_id() }}</h1>
        <h2>{{ transaction_id() }}</h2>
    </body>
</html>
```

## HttpClient integration

By default this bundle will check for services tagged with the `http_client.trace_id` tag and decorate them with the TraceAwareHttpClient.
When `tagDefaultClient` is enabled the default symfony http client will also be tagged and thus decorated.
This will add the trace header(s) to all outgoing requests for the tagged clients.
In traceId mode the header name can be changed with the `header` configuration option.

## Sentry integration

When enabled, the bundle will add `trace_id` and `transaction_id` tags to the Sentry reports.
